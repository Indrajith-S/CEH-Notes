- Parameters such as TTL and TCP window size in the IP header of the first packet in a TCP session plays an important role in identifying the OS running on the target machine. The TTL field determines the maximum time a packet can remain in a network, and the TCP window size determines the length of the packet reported. These values differ for different OSes: you can refer to the following table to learn the TTL values and TCP window size associated with various OSes.
